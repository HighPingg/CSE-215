\section*{Problem Set 1}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [10.]
        If we plug in the integer 1 into the expression $\frac{a - 1}{a}$, we get
        $\frac{1 - 1}{1}$ which is equivalent to 0. 0 is an integer, therefore this
        statement is false.
    \item [12.]
        If we set x = 4 and y = 9, the equation is $\sqrt{4 + 9} = \sqrt{4} + \sqrt{9}$.
        This would simplify down to 3.60555 and 7. $3.60555 \neq 7$, therefore this
        statement is false. 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem Set 2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [29a.]
        "There is an object in the set of geometric figure in the plane that is a
        square and a rectangle." - This is true because all squares are rectangles and
        there can be a square in a plane.
    \item [29b.]
        "There is an object in the set of geometric figure in the plane that is a
        rectangle, but not a square." - This is true because not all rectangles are
        squares and there are many examples of that on a plane.
    \item [29c.]
        "For all geometric figures in the plane, if the figure is a square, then it is
        a rectangle." - This is true because all squares are rectangles.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem Set 3}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [33c.]
        true
    \item [33d.]
        true
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem Set 4}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [10.]
        $\exists$ computer programs P, such that P compiles without error messages and
        P isn't correct
    \item [17.]
        $\exists$ integers d, such that 6/d is an integer, but d $\neq$ 3.
    \item [19.]
        $\exists$ n $\in \mathbb{Z}$, such that n is prime and n isn't odd and n $\neq$ 2.
    \item [21.]
        $\exists$ integers n, such that n is divisible by 6 and n isn't divisible by 2
        or by 3.
    \item [23.]
        $\exists$ a function that is differentiable, but isn't continuous.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem Set 5}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [40.]
        If x is divisible by 8, the x is divisible by 4.
    \item [42.]
        If you don't pass a comprehensive exam, then you will not obtain a masterâ€™s degree.
    \item [44.]
        $\exists$ a person that doesn't have a large income and is happy.
    \item [46.]
        $\exists$ a polynomial that has a function without a real root.
    \item [47.]
        $\forall$ computer programs, if it has reasonable [program] correctness, then it
        doesn't have error messages during translation.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem Set 6}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [41c.]
        false. It is impossible to find a value where all real numbers + 1 is equal
        to said number.
    \item [41d.]
        true. Every number multiplied by its reciprocal is equal to 1.
    \item [41f.]
        false. If x is less than y, then x - y will be negative and there is no positive
        integer that can represent a negative number.
    \item [41g.]
        true. An integer minus another integer is another integer.
    \item [41h.]
        false. There is no such positive number where every positive number multiplied
        by it will be less that that number.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Problem Set 7}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [13.]
        Valid because of universal modus ponens.
    \item [14.]
        Invalid because of inverse error.
    \item [15.]
        Invlaid becuse of converse error.
    \item [17.]
        Invalid because of converse error.
    \item [18.]
        Valid because of modus tollens.
\end{itemize}
